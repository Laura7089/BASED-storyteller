### Dramatic Speeches.
### Emotional Poetry.
### Encapsulating Tales.
#### All of these must be built,
# One word at a time.
As we all know, two heads are always better than one. Therefore, three heads are better than two, and so on, and so on.

Band together with your fellow creative intellectuals, to harness the full potential of your combined mind space. Let the imagination spill onto the paper, with Storyteller as your scribe.

Storyteller achieves a perfect parallel and synchronised combination of creative minds, by restricting each writer to contribute only one word at a time to the work at hand.

Once a creative contributor senses a natural finish to your combined magnum opus, that individual may bring the writing session to a close, and publish the completed piece, by simply writing a full stop.
